# (e)mbedded (l)inux (b)uilding (b)locks - containerized C++ build and runtime environment

This building block provides a way to build, run, debug, test, perform static code analysis and generate documentation of any C++ project in a containerized manner and offers:

-   local and CI/CD build system
-   C++ Static Code Analyzer
-   C++ Unit Test with doctest
-   generation of documentation with doxygen
-   debugging hello world service with gdbserver
-   signal handling (e.g. `SIGTERM`) in the example application

There is also an example that shows the usage with a `hello world` service. This `hello world` service application implements signal handling and terminates on `SIGTERM`. Together with the runtime image from [bb-cplusplus-container-images](https://github.com/elbb/bb-cplusplus-container-images) which traps and forwards signals in its entrypoint, it provides an example how to handle signals in a C++ docker service.

## Prerequisites
-   [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
-   [dobi](https://github.com/dnephin/dobi) (downloaded if not in `PATH`)
-   [qemu-user-static](https://github.com/multiarch/qemu-user-static#getting-started)
-   [concourse](https://concourse-ci.org/) (ci/cd)
-   [JFrog Artifactory Community Edition for C/C++](<https://bintray.com/jfrog/product/JFrog-Artifactory-Cpp-CE/view>) (also available in dev environment <https://github.com/elbb/elbb-dev-environment>) (optional for dobi targets, mandatory for usage of the concourse ci/cd pipeline)

## Using dobi for local build

dobi should only be used via the `dobi.sh` script, because there important variables are set and the right scripts are included.

Predifined resources were provided for this building block and are listed below:

```sh
./dobi.sh build    # build the building block
./dobi.sh test     # run all tests
./dobi.sh analyze  # perform static code analyze of the building block
./dobi.sh version  # generate version informations
./dobi.sh doxygen  # generate documentation with doxygen
./dobi.sh debug    # start gdbserver for debugging
```

The alias `build` in this building block calls all dobi c++ build jobs. These c++ build jobs use conan to cross compile artifacts. Conan builds necessary dependent artifacts. By default these build jobs use a docker container connected to the `elbb-dev` docker network running the builder image. These build jobs try to upload dependent artifacts to a conan artifactory in this docker network. E.g. you can use the dev environment (<https://github.com/elbb/elbb-dev-environment>) to use a local conan artifactory. This is an optional feature though, the build job will not fail if uploading fails.

If you want to use the optional conan artifactory, you can configure it via the following environment variables:

```sh
NETWORK=yourDockerNetwork CONAN_REMOTE=yourConanArtifactoryURL CONAN_LOGIN_USERNAME=yourUsername CONAN_PASSWORD=yourPassword CONAN_SSL_VERIFICATION=false ./dobi.sh build
```

A more convenient way is to set these environment variables in a `local.env` file. See "[Local project variables](#local-project-variables)".


### Using dobi for static code analysis

This building block offers the possibility to perform a static code analysis. The following tools and analyzers are used for the execution.

- CodeChecker
- Clang- Tidy
- Clang- Static Analyzer

The results are automatically provided to a CodeChecker web server for analysis. It is recommended to use the dev environment (<https://github.com/elbb/elbb-dev-environment>) provided by elbb.

**Notice:** Before start the code analysis, be sure that the CodeChecker Web Server is up and running.

With the following dobi command, the analysis of the sample code can be started:

```sh
./dobi.sh analyze
```

If you don't use the elbb dev environment, you can change the default CodeChecker URL of storing the analyze results with the following dobi command:

```sh
CODECHECKER_URL=http://codechecker-web:8001/Default ./dobi.sh analyze
```

By default the `analyze` job is started in a docker container connected to `elbb-dev` docker network used in the dev environment (<https://github.com/elbb/elbb-dev-environment>). If you use an own codechecker instance in another docker network, you have to adapt it via:

```sh
CODECHECKER_URL=http://codechecker-web:8001/Default NETWORK=yourDockerNetwork ./dobi.sh analyze
```

A more convenient way is to set this environment variable in a `local.env` file. Copy `local.env.template` to `local.env` and adapt `local.env` accordingly.


### Using dobi for unit test

This building block offers the possibility to perform a unit test of your source code. The following tool is used for the execution.

<https://github.com/onqtam/doctest>

With the following dobi command, a example unit test of a sample code can be started:

```sh
./dobi.sh test
```

### Using dobi for doxygen documentation

This building block offers the possibility to generate documentation of your source code. The following tool is used for the execution.

<https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html>

With the following dobi command, the generation of the documentation of the sample code can be started:

```sh
./dobi.sh doxygen
```

Results can be found in subfolder: gen/doxygen

#### doxygen configuration

This building block provides a doxygen configuration file `service/Doxyfile`. Use this file to configure doxygen for your use.

For further information how to configure doxygen, see:

<https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/config.html>


### Using dobi to start debugging

This building block provides a setup to debug a x86 C++ component via remote debugging with a gdbserver.

For this purpose a dobi job is provided to do the startup of a gdbserver. For demonstration purposes, the "Hello World" service was used as test application. To start the debug session, the following command can be used.

```sh
./dobi.sh debug
```

The gdbserver is now ready and waiting for a connection to a gdb debugger.

#### Setup - IDE (vscode)

The navigation through the code, display of variables, setting breakpoints, etc., can be done with Visual Studio code or similar IDEs.
Before debugging C++ code in Visual Studio Code (vscode) you have to install the extension 'Native Debug` by WebFreak <https://github.com/WebFreak001/code-debug>

#### Debug configuration - launch.json

This section describes the process of connecting to a remote gdb session via vscode.
In order to make a remote gdb connection to the gdbserver running in the container you have to configure your launch.json.

The gdb debugger itself, called gdb-multiarch, is availabe in a docker image elbb/bb-cplusplus-builder.
A local installation of the gdb debugger is not neccessary on your host system.

This buildblock provides a bash script, called gdb-multiarch.sh to handle the communication to the dockerized gdb debugger.

An example launch.json (.vscode/launch.json) for application cplusplus_service could look like this.

- name: hello-world-x86_64 (remote gdb)

- program: /install/cplusplus_service<br>
location of the binary file in the docker container

- miDebuggerPath: "${workspaceFolder}/gdb-multiarch.sh"<br>
location of the gdb-multiarch debugger

- miDebuggerServerAddress: localhost:1234<br>
The Docker container starts a gdbserver at port 1234

- sourceFileMap:
The docker container mounts the C++ sources from  service to  /source in the container.

Therefore a mapping from  /source to  service must be setup in the sourceFileMap.

            "miDebuggerServerAddress": "localhost:1234",
            "miDebuggerArgs": "x86_64",
            "sourceFileMap": {
                "/source/": "${workspaceFolder}/service/"
            },
            "setupCommands": [
                {
                    "description": "Enable pretty-printing for gdb",
                    "text": "-enable-pretty-printing",
                    "ignoreFailures": true
                }
            ]
        },
    ]
}
```
#### Remote target debugging

This building block provides also a cross-compiled "service hello world example" for aarch64 and armv7 architecture.

The next steps are exemplary for the aarch64 architecture and show the way to remote debugging on the target.

**at host system**
```sh
./dobi.sh cplusplus-service-build-aarch64-dev
```
The creation of this example image for the aarch64 architecture was done using dobi. Of course the image can also be created with a CI/CD like concourse.

**at target system**
- pull the docker image

- start a docker container running the image

```sh
docker run --rm -it --entrypoint /bin/bash -p 1234:1234 YourDockerImage
```

- start gdbserver in running target container

```sh
gdbserver :1234 /usr/local/bin/cplusplus_service
```
**at host system**

This buildblock provides a visual studio code example debug file (.vscode/launch.json).

- open launch.json

- see chapter "name": "hello-world-aarch64 (remote gdb)"

- adjust ip address of element "miDebuggerServerAddress"

- start debug session "hello-world-aarch64 (remote gdb)"

### Default project variables

Edit `./default.env` to set default project variables.

### Local project variables

If you want to override project variables, copy `./local.env.template` to `./local.env` and edit `./local.env` accordingly.<br>
`./local.env` is ignored by git via `./.gitignore`.

## Using concourse CI for a CI/CD build

The pipeline file must be uploaded to concourse CI via `fly`.
Enter the build users ssh private key into the file `ci/credentials.template.yaml` and rename it to `ci/credentials.yaml`.
Copy the file `ci/email.template.yaml` to `ci/email.yaml` and enter the email server configuration and email addresses.
For further information how to configure the email notification, see: <https://github.com/pivotal-cf/email-resource>

**Note: `credentials.yaml` and `email.yaml` are ignored by `.gitignore` and will not be checked in.**

In further releases there will be a key value store to keep track of the users credentials.
Before setting the pipeline you might login first to your concourse instance `fly -t <target> login --concourse-url http://<concourse>:<port>`. See the [fly documentation](https://concourse-ci.org/fly.html) for more help.
Upload the pipeline file with fly:

    $ fly -t <target> set-pipeline -n -p bb-cplusplus -l ci/config.yaml -l ci/credentials.yaml -l ci/email.yaml -c ci/pipeline.yaml

After successfully uploading the pipeline to concourse CI login and unpause it. After that the pipeline should be triggered by new commits on the main branch (or new tags if enabled in `ci/pipeline.yaml`).

# Concourse pipeline integration guide

**Before continue reading please make sure that you don't use the `pipeline.yaml` as a base to work on. Instead use the `example/ci/pipeline.yaml` as base file for your integration.**

For using this concourse CI pipeline it is recommended to have two config files:

-   `config.yaml`: for production purposes
-   `config.local.yaml`: for development and testing purposes

The `config.yaml` is used to access the projects production release repository and branch and a real cloud S3 endpoint to store version artifacts.
The `config.local.yaml` is used to develop and test the pipeline for building blocks. It is used to work with your private fork or local git repository, your local docker registry as well as a local S3 endpoint.

# Example concourse CI pipeline

This example is intended to show the integration of a build pipeline in a derived building block.

## Adaptions for your building block

This section describes what needs to be done within the several files. 
**Note: `credentials.yaml` is ignored by `.gitignore` and will not be checked in.**

### config.yaml

Open the `config.yaml` and specify the fields that are described.
This config file shows an example for a fictive building block called `bb-example`.

Note 1: If you are using a real S3 endpoint you should enter those data. If you are using the local test environment specify like below.
Note 2: If you are using e.g. dockerhub as destination, you can specify `bb_destination: elbb/bb-example`
Note 3: If you are running the local docker registry, you might add this to the `bb_destination_insecure_registries` section. If you are using e.g. dockerhub or another ssl featured registry you can leave the brackets empty. e.g. `bb_destination_insecure_registries: []`.

    ---
    # General stuff
    # -------------
    ## Specifies the name of the building block
    bb_name: bb-example
    ## Specifies the destination of the docker image artifact
    # Using local environment for docker registry
    bb_destination: registry:5000/elbb/bb-example
    ## Specifies insecure docker registries, format "host:port" or "ip:port"
    bb_destination_insecure_registries: ["registry:5000"]

    # Versioning stuff
    # ----------------
    ## Specifies the version used for bb-gitversion
    bb_gitversion_version: 0.4.2

    # Git relevant stuff
    # ------------------
    ## Specify the git repository to work with
    git_source: https://github.com/elbb/bb-example.git
    ## Specify the git branch to work with
    git_branch: example
    ## This enables/disables ssl verification of the git resource
    git_skip_ssl_verification: false

    # S3 relevant stuff
    # -----------------
    ## Specify the S3 endpoint URI
    # Using local environment for min.io
    s3_endpoint: http://minio:9000
    ## This enables/disables the ssl verification for the S3 endpoint
    s3_skip_ssl_verification: true

### credentials.yaml

**Note: Make sure that you have set up ssh access with your ssh-key in your git repository.**

Fill in your ssh private key and your credentials for the docker registry and S3 server in `credentials.example.yaml` and rename it to `credentials.yaml`.

### pipeline.yaml

We assume that the git repository for bb-example contains parts the following file structure:

    .
    ├── docker
    |   ├── Dockerfile

As a build artifact a docker image is wanted versioned with bb-gitversion.

The example builds the docker image with the Dockerfile located in `docker/Dockerfile` and creates a tag generated by a previous step running `bb-gitversion`.

Adapt the last section in the `pipeline.yaml` to match your needs. The `image-((bb_name))` will be called `image-bb-example` and is needed to define the target docker image. The name and destination is configured in `config.yaml`. This image section does not need to be modified. But you might to modify the job called `Create docker image for ((bb_name)) and push it`.
The only two parts you need to modify are in the last task `put: image-((bb_name))` 

-   `build` (docker build context) 
-   `dockerfile` (location of your Dockerfile). 

If you want your image to be tagged as `latest` keep the value at `true`, otherwise switch to `false`.

`source` specifies the root of your checked out git repository and does not need to be adapted.

    resources:
    ...
      - name: image-((bb_name))
        type: docker-image
        source:
          repository: ((bb_destination))
          username: ((registry_user))
          password: ((registry_password))
          tag: latest
          insecure_registries: ((bb_destination_insecure_registries))
    ...
    jobs:
    ...
      - name: Create docker image for ((bb_name)) and push it
        public: true
        plan:
          - in_parallel:
              - get: source
              - get: s3-gitversion
                passed: [Generate gitversion and put it on S3]
                trigger: true
                params:
                  unpack: true
          - put: image-((bb_name))
            params:
              build: source/docker
              dockerfile: source/docker/Dockerfile
              additional_tags: s3-gitversion/version
              tag_as_latest: true

Note: If the S3 bucket for the specific building block does not exist, it will be created. The files that are stored within that bucket contain various versioning information. The name is suffixed with the Version: `gitversion-<Version>.tar.gz` where `<Version>` is a full semantic version for `master` branch (e.g. `bb-example-0.1.0`) and has additional informations for every `other branch` (e.g. `0.1.0-Branch.origin-example-branch.Sha.f48c55b4dea2b666574f03f34e02001123f7993a`).

## Using the pipeline

Use `fly` to setup the pipeline with concourse CI.
Before setting the pipeline you might login first to your concourse instance `fly -t <target> login --concourse-url http://<concourse>:<port>`. See the [fly documentation](https://concourse-ci.org/fly.html) for more help.

Once you've setup your concourse CI server (either hosted or local) upload the pipeline:

    $ cd example/ci
    $ fly -t <target> set-pipeline -n -p bb-example -l ci/config.yaml -l ci/credentials.yaml -c pipeline.yaml

If your build succeeds, overwrite the the `pipeline.yaml` and `ci/` with your modified pipeline from `example/ci`. You are free to remove `example/ci`.

```

```
